## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- meta(discoverability): outcome-first whenToUse + canonical categories (full sweep)

  Second-pass review of every remaining node against docs-starter/nodes/14-node-discoverability.md:

  - Rewrote whenToUse where it led with mechanism or failed to name the incumbent it loses to (aws-nova, aws-bedrock Claude/Embedding, cloudinary FileContent, crawl Apify Starter/Results, all 9 gtm lead-gen nodes, email, gce-toolkit, pdf-render, all 4 search nodes, x-search, xai-grok, openai ChatGPTAgent/OpenAIAgent, pinecone Query/Upload, flow SendObject). Strong existing meta left unchanged.
  - Normalized node-definition category to the canonical taxonomy (AI | Ingest | Storage | Output | Flow), TitleCase, and made it agree with package.json gravity.nodes[].category: aws-s3/cloudinary/aws-dynamodb casing storage->Storage; aws-toolkit Textract + aws-medical + ingest ElevenLabs ingest->AI; ingest SpatialIngest ->Storage; pinecone Knowledge->Storage; salesforce Productivity->Storage; slack Communication->Output; email + flow SendObject/Suggestions ->Output.
  - Attach-target wiring facts kept generic ("an agent node"); specific node names retained only in decision rules.
