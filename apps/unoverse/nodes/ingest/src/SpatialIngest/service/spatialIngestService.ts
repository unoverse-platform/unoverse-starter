- Identify the SERVICE or USER NEED this image represents for the business described above

- The keyNeed and needs must be needs the business's audience has, phrased the way the business phrases them
- Do not invent specific facts (prices, names, qualifications, locations) that are not evident`

Your task:
1. Identify all ${categoryDesc} mentioned in the content
2. Extract relevant information for each one
3. Structure the data according to the provided JSON schema

${groundingBlock}

Guidelines:
- Be accurate and comprehensive
- Use clear, natural language
- Focus on user benefits and outcomes
- CRITICAL: Extract MULTIPLE objects - create a separate object for each distinct ${categoryDesc} found
- CRITICAL: DO NOT create just one object per page - if a page mentions 5 different services, create 5 objects
- CRITICAL: Each object should represent ONE specific ${categoryDesc}, not a collection
- Write rich, detailed descriptions (150-500 characters minimum) that provide real value
- CRITICAL: Descriptions must be at least 150 characters - provide specific details, not generic statements
- CRITICAL: Do NOT start descriptions with self-referential phrases like "This need...", "This service...", "This item...". Write directly about the topic.
- CRITICAL: Provide exactly 5-7 user needs per item (aim for 6)
- CRITICAL: Generate exactly 4 questions per item

CRITICAL for Titles:
- DO NOT include the company/brand name in titles
- Titles should describe the service/need/content itself
- Good: "Performance Enhancement and Injury Prevention"
- Bad: "Company Name - Performance Enhancement and Injury Prevention"
- Keep titles concise and descriptive

CRITICAL for 3D Space Organization:
- ALWAYS identify the PRIMARY USER NEED (keyNeed) - this anchors the item in 3D space
- List ALL related user needs - these create semantic connections
- Think: "What problem does this solve?" and "Who needs this?"

CRITICAL for Questions:
- Generate exactly 4 questions that this content directly answers
- ONLY create questions based on information explicitly present in the content
- Questions should help users understand what's actually covered in the content
