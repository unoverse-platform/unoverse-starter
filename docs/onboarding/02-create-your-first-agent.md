Build a chat Agent in **Canvas**: a trigger that receives the message, a model that thinks, and a response that streams back. Ten minutes, no code.

## Before you begin

The platform is running (`unoverse dev`) and **Canvas** is open at http://localhost:3001. You have an OpenAI API key, and the OpenAI package is installed from the [marketplace](./01-marketplace-nodes.md).

## Build it

<Steps>
<Step title="Add your OpenAI credential">

In **Canvas**, open **Credentials** and click **New credential**. Select the **OpenAI API** type, name it, paste your API key, and save. Nodes never read keys from config or env files; they request credentials at execution time, decrypted and injected by the platform.

</Step>
<Step title="Create a workflow">

Click **Create New Workflow** and name it. An empty **Canvas** opens.

</Step>
<Step title="Add three nodes">

The workflow needs three nodes:

1. <span className="node-chip">Input Trigger</span> receives the user's message.
2. <span className="node-chip">OpenAI Stream</span> sends it to the model and streams the reply.
3. <span className="node-chip">AI Response</span> displays the reply to the user.

Drag <span className="node-chip">Input Trigger</span> and <span className="node-chip">OpenAI Stream</span> from the node library onto the **Canvas**.

![An Input Trigger node on the canvas](../images/onboarding/inputTrigger.png)

<span className="node-chip">AI Response</span> is a component, so it comes from **Studio**. Open **Components** in **Studio**, select **AIResponse**, and click **Copy for Canvas**. Then paste it into your **Canvas**.

![The AIResponse component in Studio with Copy for Canvas](../images/onboarding/AIResponce.png)

Now connect them left to right: <span className="node-chip">Input Trigger</span> → <span className="node-chip">OpenAI Stream</span> → <span className="node-chip">AI Response</span>.

The dots on a node's edges are **connectors**. Each output connector carries one named signal. Hover over a connector to see its name and what it carries. The names matter: they are how downstream fields reference the data, as in `signal.openaistream1.chunk`.

<span className="node-chip">OpenAI Stream</span> has more than one output, so pick the right one: connect from its `chunk` connector. `chunk` streams, so the reply flows into <span className="node-chip">AI Response</span> as the model writes it.

![Hovering a connector shows its name and what it carries](../images/onboarding/connnector.png)

<Note>
Every node instance gets an id: its type, lowercased, plus a number. Your three nodes are `inputtrigger1`, `openaistream1`, and `airesponse1`. Downstream nodes read upstream outputs through these ids: `signal.<nodeId>.<output>`.
</Note>

</Step>
<Step title="Set a test message">

Double-click <span className="node-chip">Input Trigger</span> to open its settings. Under **Testing**, enter a **Message**. This is the question that kicks off the flow when you run the trigger.

</Step>
<Step title="Configure the model">

Double-click <span className="node-chip">OpenAI Stream</span> to open its settings:

- **OpenAI API**: select the credential you created in step 1.
- **Model**: pick a GPT-5.6 variant.
- **System Prompt**: `You are a helpful assistant. Please answer the user's question.`
- **User Prompt**: `The user's question is {{signal.inputtrigger1.output.message}}`

![The OpenAI Stream settings panel](../images/onboarding/settings.png)

The double braces are a Handlebars reference: at run time it resolves to the message the trigger received.

</Step>
<Step title="Configure the response">

Double-click <span className="node-chip">AI Response</span>:

- **Main response text**: `return signal.openaistream1.chunk`

This field takes JavaScript. `chunk` is the model's streaming output, so text appears live as the model writes. The complete reply is also available as `signal.openaistream1.text` once the node finishes.

<Note>
Config fields accept two syntaxes: Handlebars (`{{signal...}}`) for templating text, and JavaScript (`return signal...`) for computing a value. Use either; don't mix them in one field.
</Note>

</Step>
<Step title="Step through it">

Your workflow saves automatically as you build; there is no save button. Just run it: press the play button on <span className="node-chip">Input Trigger</span> to execute it with your test message. When a node completes, the next node in the chain becomes **armed** and flashes, meaning it is ready to run. Press its play button to step forward, inspecting each node's output as you go.

![Input Trigger completed, OpenAI Stream armed and ready to step](../images/onboarding/stepDebug.png)

The moment a node runs, its output is ready to inspect. Double-click the node and open the **Debug** tab. It shows every signal the node produced and the exact value each one carried on this run.

Step through all three nodes and watch the reply stream into <span className="node-chip">AI Response</span>.

</Step>
</Steps>

## One more thing

Everything you just built by hand, Claude Code can build for you. The platform ships a builder MCP, registered by this repo's `.mcp.json`:

1. With the platform running, open this repo in Claude Code and approve the `unoverse-builder` server when it asks. Type `/mcp` at any time to confirm it shows as connected.
2. In **Canvas**, create a new empty workflow and copy the `wf-xxxxxx` id from the URL.
3. Ask:

> Bind workflow wf-xxxxxx, then build a chat agent: input trigger → OpenAI → response display. Test each stage with runTest before adding the next.

Claude binds to that one **Canvas**, builds stage by stage, and runs each stage while you watch the nodes appear live. It can't see or touch any other workflow.
