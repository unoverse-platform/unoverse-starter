Set up your local development environment. You'll have the platform running in a few minutes.

## How it works

[`unoverse-starter`](https://github.com/unoverse-platform/unoverse-starter) is a **template repository**. You create your own copy on GitHub, and everything you build lives in that copy: your nodes, your components, your Agent skills. The platform itself runs as Docker images that you pull, not source you compile.

<Warning>
**A license is required.** The starter repository is the scaffold, not the platform. The platform ships as licensed Docker images, and your registry token is what authorizes downloading them. Without a license, nothing runs.
</Warning>

## Before you begin

| Tool | Version | Install |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Docker** | 24+ | https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/ |
| **Node.js** | 20+ | https://nodejs.org/ or `nvm install 20` |
| **Git** | 2.x | https://git-scm.com/ |

**Before you start, you need a PostgreSQL database and a Redis instance.** Both can be managed services, such as DigitalOcean, Supabase, or AWS RDS, or run locally for development. The platform does not bundle either one: your databases stay under your own management, backups, and policies. PostgreSQL needs the pgvector extension, which managed providers include by default. Local setups are covered in Troubleshooting below.

Setup asks for four credentials. One comes from unoverse; the rest are yours.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="unoverse provides" icon="key">
Your registry token, issued with your license. It authorizes downloading the platform images and activates your installation.
</Card>
<Card title="You provide" icon="database">
Your PostgreSQL connection string, your Redis credentials, and your auth provider's issuer, client ID, and audience. Any OIDC-compatible provider works: Auth0, Okta, Microsoft Entra ID.

<Note>
Apple Silicon Macs run everything natively. The platform images are multi-arch (amd64 + arm64); no Rosetta needed.
</Note>

## Set up the platform

<Steps>
<Step title="Create your repository">

On [`unoverse-platform/unoverse-starter`](https://github.com/unoverse-platform/unoverse-starter), click **Use this template → Create a new repository**. This gives you a clean, independent copy. Then clone it:

```bash Clone your copy
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/unoverse-starter.git ~/unoverse
cd ~/unoverse
```

<Tip>
Clone before opening the folder in your editor. Opening it first can create a `.claude/` directory that blocks the clone.
</Tip>

</Step>
<Step title="Run the setup wizard">

```bash Setup wizard
./unoverse init
```

The wizard asks for your DOCR token, database URL, Redis, and auth credentials. It writes your `.env` file, logs into the registry, and pulls all platform images.

Use `./unoverse` (with the `./`) the first time. After init completes, the CLI installs itself to your PATH and `unoverse` works from anywhere.

</Step>
<Step title="Start the dev environment">

```bash Start everything
unoverse dev
```

One command: starts all containers, installs workspace dependencies, and builds your node packages so the platform loads them.

</Step>
<Step title="Set up the database">

```bash Database setup
unoverse db-setup
```

Runs all migrations and seeds the database. Safe to re-run at any time; migrations are tracked and only applied once.

</Step>
<Step title="Verify">

```bash Health check
unoverse check
```

Every line should be green: services up, health endpoints responding, packages built, nodes loaded, **Canvas** reachable. If anything fails, run `unoverse doctor` for a diagnosis.

</Step>
<Step title="Open Canvas">

| Service | URL | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Canvas** | http://localhost:3001 | Build, manage, and observe Agents |
| **Studio** | http://localhost:3002 | Design components, templates, and skills (dev only) |
| **API** | http://localhost:4105 | The unoverse engine's public surface |

</Step>
</Steps>

## How you'll work

Development is local first. The whole platform runs on your machine in Docker, and it is the same platform that runs in production. The loop:

1. **Build your assets in Studio**: components, templates, custom nodes, services, and skills.
2. **Manage content and availability in Spatial**: ingest your content and control which assets your Agents can find.
3. **Wire them into Agents in Canvas.**
4. **Run and test locally**: step through nodes, preview components, talk to your Agent.
5. **Deploy when you're happy.** `unoverse deploy` runs the [Runbooks](../runbooks/overview.md) against your server.

Production only enters at step 5. That is also the only point where the second environment file matters.

## The two `.env` files

Your project has two environment files, both at the root and both gitignored:

| File | Purpose | Used by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.env` | Local development | `docker compose` on your machine |
| `.env.production` | Production deployment | `unoverse deploy`, copied to your server |

Each file has a template in the repo: copy it and fill in your values. The production file also names the server to deploy to. At deploy time, `unoverse deploy` reads it and runs the platform's Ansible playbooks against that server, following the [Runbooks](../runbooks/overview.md).

<Warning>
Don't mix them up. `.env` is local development on your laptop; `.env.production` is your production server.
</Warning>

## Where your code lives

Three folders are mounted into the running platform. Everything you build goes in one of them, and **Studio** is the workbench for all three: it is where you build your custom nodes and services, your design components and templates, and your Agent skills and prompt blocks.

| Folder | What | Guide |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `apps/unoverse/nodes/` | **Logic**: custom workflow node packages | [Create Your First Node](./03-create-your-first-node.md) |
| `apps/unoverse/rx/` | **Design**: components, templates, styles | [Components and Templates](./05-components-and-templates.md) |
| `apps/unoverse/prompts/` | **Behavior**: Agent skills and prompt blocks | [Create Your First Agent](./02-create-your-first-agent.md) |

You don't have to build everything yourself. The **marketplace** offers ready-made nodes and services to install into your platform.

## Daily workflow

```bash Daily workflow
unoverse dev                                 # start your day
# edit nodes/, rx/, or prompts/
unoverse build                               # build all + restart
unoverse build @unoverse-platform/my-node    # or build one package
unoverse stop                                # end your day
```

Every command is documented in the [CLI reference](./00-cli.md).

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="unauthorized when pulling images">

Log in to the registry again with your DOCR token:

```bash Registry login
echo "YOUR_DOCR_TOKEN" | docker login registry.digitalocean.com -u YOUR_DOCR_TOKEN --password-stdin
```

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Services not starting">

Check the logs for the failing service:

```bash Service logs
unoverse logs unoverse
unoverse logs canvas
```

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can't reach database server at 127.0.0.1">

Inside a Docker container, `localhost` refers to the container itself, not your machine. If you run a local Postgres, use Docker's host alias in your `DATABASE_URL`:

```bash .env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@host.docker.internal:5432/gravity
```

Not needed for managed databases (DigitalOcean, Supabase, and similar).

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="extension vector is not available during db-setup">

Your local Postgres needs the pgvector extension. Managed databases ship with it pre-installed.

```bash Install pgvector
brew install pgvector                      # Mac
sudo apt install postgresql-16-pgvector    # Ubuntu/Debian (match your PG version)
```

If you run Postgres in Docker, use the `pgvector/pgvector:pg16` image instead of plain `postgres`. Restart Postgres and re-run `unoverse db-setup`.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Redis connection refused">

For local development, start Redis with Docker:

```bash Local Redis
docker run -d --name unoverse-redis -p 6379:6379 redis:7-alpine
```

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Still stuck">

```bash Diagnose
unoverse doctor
```

It checks the whole stack and tells you what's wrong.
