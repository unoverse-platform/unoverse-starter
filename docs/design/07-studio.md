**View and test your work — mock states in isolation, or live against the real platform, on every channel at once.**

**Studio** (the Unoverse workbench) is to Unoverse what Storybook is to React — but cross-platform, streaming, and connectable to the live agent backend. It is served by the running platform; nothing extra to install.

Because **Studio** is **just another MCP client** — same SDK, same definition resources, same component stream as production — what you see is what ships ([02](./02-sdui-and-mcp-apps.md)). Hot reload isn't a dev trick: it's the same `resources/subscribe → updated` mechanism that live-updates production channels.

The top nav is flat — **Apps · Components · Styles · Nodes · AI** — and a header **org switcher** scopes the whole **Studio**: the Apps list, the Components list (the design system + the selected org's own components only), and the preview theme. **All** shows everything cross-org, with an org badge per card. Atoms have no **Studio** view — they're authoring-time only; the server expands them before anything is served.

## 🧪 Mode A — Mock (isolation)

Render a component or template with **mock data and mock history**, no backend logic involved. This is your daily loop while designing.

### Mock data = prop defaults. The state picker = the `states/` folder.

Two mechanisms, zero hand-maintained fixtures:

1. **Prop `default`s are the mock data.** Studio renders every definition from its declared defaults — which is why defaults should be realistic content, not empty strings.
2. **Two docks — layouts on top, states on the left.** A component has two axes, and **Studio** never shares one control between them:
   - its **layout faces** — the root `Switch on defaultState` cases (`inline`, `focused`, a custom `product`) — are a **toggle at the top of the toolbar** (first control after the name). Any face name appears automatically; `inline` always leads; a flat component with no face switch shows no toggle. Any non-inline face gets the grow container.
   - its own **`states/`** files (a wizard's private steps, `goals.json … results.json`) are the **left-rail list** under the component's name.

   Picking a face writes `defaultState` into the slice; picking a state walks the wizard — both via the same generic `setValue` a real component's buttons use. (Templates work the same way: the app's `states/` are the picker — one active at a time; acting inside the preview transitions state like the runtime.)

So "viewable states" is not extra work — it falls straight out of organizing a definition into layers ([03](./03-components.md)): the folder that structures your `Switch` cases is the same folder **Studio** reads. Use the picker to exercise every discriminant value (each wizard `step`, `inline/focused`, each `callState` phase), and vary prop defaults to check edge data (empty lists, long text — how you catch a `bind` without a default).

**Apps show their widget's states too.** Selecting an app template (a single-widget shell) also lists its **seeded component's** states as pills — a wizard's steps are one click each, activated by writing the widget's `Switch` discriminant into its slice, exactly what its own buttons do.

### 📋 Copy for Canvas — drop a component onto a workflow

When a component is selected, **Studio** shows a **`⧉ Copy for Canvas`** button. It copies the component as a **Canvas node** to your clipboard; then **`Cmd+V` on any workflow Canvas** pastes it in, sized to the component's `nodeSize`. This is **how a design component reaches a workflow** — the node library no longer lists components, so you preview it here, copy it, and paste it where the workflow needs it. (No file edit, no restart; it's just placing the node.)

---

## 🔴 Mode B — Live (the proof)

Flip the toggle and **Studio** connects **as an MCP client to your real running platform**. Real workflows stream real components, select real templates, deliver real data — into the local preview. You are watching production behavior before shipping.

Use Live mode to verify the things mock can't:

- your component's **node** receives and merges streamed `COMPONENT_DATA` correctly,
- the **template selection** picks your app for the intents you wrote `whenToUse` for,
- **reaction flow**: the widget streams in (or is clicked) into a state, the template's `where` surface frames it, its ✕ returns it inline cleanly,
- **turn lifecycle**: thinking indicators derived from `isStreaming` appear and — critically — clear.

## 🔬 DevTools — when something looks wrong

| Tool | Shows | Use it when |
|---|---|---|
| **State inspector** | the three buckets live — each component slice, template state, the timeline | "my `visibleWhen` never fires" → look at the actual key/value; it's usually a key-name or bucket mismatch |
| **Component stream log** | every `COMPONENT_INIT` / `COMPONENT_DATA` / `TEMPLATE_DATA` / `WORKFLOW_STATE` with timing | "data isn't arriving" vs "data arrives but my bind is wrong" — this log settles it in seconds |

Debugging order, always: **stream log** (did it arrive?) → **state inspector** (is it in the bucket I read?) → the definition (is my bind/condition right?). Never start by editing the definition on a guess — see the data first.

---

## 🔁 The full loop

```bash
vi rx/components/pricecard/pricecard.json   # 1. edit (schema validates as you type)
docker compose restart unoverse              # 2. the node re-synthesizes from the definition at boot
# 3. Studio: mock states → looks right
# 4. Studio: live mode → streams right
```

For pure definition edits (layouts, styles, copy), the resource subscription refreshes the preview live — no restart at all. A restart is only needed when the component's **node** must change (new props, a new component, discovery meta), because node definitions synthesize from your JSON at boot — there is no code generation step, ever.
